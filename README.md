R-Page-Visits-Funnel

Company1 has asked you to analyze data on visits to their website. Your job is to build a funnel, which is a description of how many people continue to the next step of a multi-step process.

In this case, our funnel is going to describe the following process:

A user visits Company1.com
A user adds a t-shirt to their cart
A user clicks “checkout”
A user actually purchases a t-shirt

Which step in the funnel is the weakest? 
How can the website be improved to strengthen this weakness? 
What is the average time from site access to purchase?
